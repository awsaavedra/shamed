    // What is MutableLiveData, so you don't want the reference to change?
    // ans: MutableLiveData is a bucket for your values. It implements Observable, which allows
    // views to observe its state and change in response to it.

    // Why is it being in the viewModel make a difference?
    // ViewModels persist across orientation change. If you were to store a LiveData in an Activity
    // it would be destroyed on orientation change, so you lose state.

        //1) Data inputted by user (assuming all data is mandatory)
        //2) daily inputs: i.e. breakfast, lunch, dinner (3 saved states for instance)
